# Hello, I’m @De-Zwaan, 

<p>I have a wide range of interests, ranging from microbiology and biological process design and analysis to 
graphical representations of otherwise abstract concepts and tinkering with complex mechanical designs and electrical 'engineering'.</p>

<p>There are many more things I would like to explore. When I do, there is a chance it will be uploaded here. If I am feeling confident I might even make the repository public.</p>

<p>If you're reading this, have a great day!</p>
